# Predicting-Stock-Market
Business understanding
The stock market is dependent on many factors and because of this dependency, the prediction of the stock market is very complicated. However, many data is generated every second from multiple sources that may help to predict the stock market using advanced machine learning algorithm. In this code, I represent a method which can help to predict the stock market. In this project, I will respond to 3 questions:

Question 1:
How did the stock market (close column) change from May 2019 to June 2019?
Question 2:
How did the stock market (close column) change from August 2004 to June 2018?
Question 3:
Is there any way to predict the stock market (close column) from May to July 2019?

1. Installations: Please install python and import following packages and libraries:
alpha_vantage.timeseries, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, numpy,sklearn.preprocessing (MinMaxScaler), keras.models (Sequential, Dense, Dropout, LSTM)

2. Project Motivation
Some people says that predicting stock market is impossible. Lets give it a shot.

3. File Descriptions
The data is gathered from the GOOGL stock market

4. How to Interact with your project
There are different models to predict stock market. I only tested one of them. 

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
You are more tham welcome to use the code. I appreciate if you refer to my github.
